    <h1>Build Your Own Voice Assistant with PowerShell 🎙️</h1>

    <p>Welcome back to <strong>techsavvyp.com</strong>!Today we’re doing something futuristic and fun: creating a mini voice assistant using PowerShell. That’s right—your computer will talk to you, greet you, and even deliver custom messages. No downloads, no AI models—just pure PowerShell magic!</p>

    <h2>🧠 What You’ll Learn</h2>
    <p>We’ll use the built-in <code>System.Speech</code> library to make your computer speak. You’ll be able to customize greetings, reminders, or even jokes. It’s perfect for kids, coders, or anyone who wants their PC to feel a little more alive.</p>

    <h2>🛠️ Step-by-Step Guide</h2>
    <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open PowerShell (you don’t need admin mode for this one).</p>
    <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Paste the code below into the PowerShell window.</p>

But you might be wondering:
“How do I make it greet me every time I open PowerShell?”
Let’s turn that one-time script into a permanent companion by saving it to your PowerShell profile.
</p>

<h2>🧠 Step-by-Step Guide</h2>
    <p>1. 	Open PowerShell (regular mode is fine).
2. 	Type this command and press Enter:
"notepad $PROFILE"
3. 	If the file doesn’t exist, PowerShell will ask to create it—click Yes.</p>

<p>
4.      If your proile is empty just paste the code,save and close notepad,if it's not empty paste the code below the already existing code:

<pre><code>Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Speech
$speak = New-Object System.Speech.Synthesis.SpeechSynthesizer

$speak.Speak("Welcome back to techsavvyp dot com.")
$speak.Speak("Your next update is scheduled for September 26th, 2025.")
$speak.Speak("Stay curious, stay creative, and stay tech savvy!")</code></pre>

<p>Just change the <code>$speak.Speak()</code> lines to match your theme!
If you want,you can add some conditions like:

<pre><code>
if ((Get-Date).DayOfWeek -eq 'Friday') {
    $speak.Speak("Happy Friday! Time to wrap up the week.")
}
</code></pr>
</p>

    <h2>🧸 Why It’s Useful</h2>
    <p>This is a great way to learn about PowerShell objects, libraries, and automation. Plus, it’s fun and easy to share with friends or family. You can even schedule it to run at startup for a daily greeting!</p>

    <h2>🎉 Outro</h2>
    <p>And there you have it—your very own voice assistant, built with PowerShell and a sprinkle of imagination. Whether you’re coding, learning, or just having fun, this project brings your computer to life in a whole new way.</p>

    <p>🗓️ The next Tech Savvy update drops on <strong>September 26th, 2025</strong> (Greek Time). Until then, keep exploring, keep creating, and as always...Stay Tech Savvy!</p>

    <p><strong>Stay Tech Savvy! 💡💬</strong></p>
