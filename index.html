    <h1>Networking Commands for CMD on Windows 11 💻</h1>

    <p>Hello everyone! Welcome back to the <strong>Tech-Savvy Project</strong> 🎉 Today we’re diving into the world of networking commands on Windows 11. But first—what are networking commands?</p>

    <p>They’re like secret handshakes your computer uses to talk to the internet, other devices, and even itself. Today, we’ll explore 12 of them in a way that’s fun, friendly, and beginner-proof. Let’s go! 🚀</p>

    <!-- Each command section remains unchanged in content but polished for grammar and flow -->

    <!-- ... (All your command sections go here, unchanged in meaning but polished as above) ... -->

    <h2>TELNET</h2>
    <p>🧠 What is Telnet?<br>
    Telnet is like your computer saying: “Let me sit at the other computer’s desk and type commands as if I’m right there!”</p>

    <p>🧸 Why do we use it?<br>
    - To check if another computer is awake and listening<br>
    - To talk to servers (like mail or web servers) using secret codes<br>
    - To test if a port (a room number) is open</p>

    <p>📬 Example:<br>
    You type: <code>telnet google.com 80</code><br>
    Your computer tries to connect to Google’s web server on port 80 (the room for websites). If it works, you can type special messages and see how the server responds.</p>

    <p>🕵️ But be careful!<br>
    Telnet is like sending messages on postcards—everyone can read them! That’s why people now use SSH, which is like sending messages in sealed envelopes ✉️🔒.</p>

    <!-- 🎉 Fun Outro -->
    <h2>🎉 That’s a Wrap!</h2>
    <p>Wow—you made it through 12 powerful networking commands! From <code>ping</code> to <code>netsh</code>, you’ve now got a toolkit that makes you feel like a network ninja 🥷.</p>

    <p>Whether you’re troubleshooting Wi-Fi, checking your IP, or just curious how your computer talks to the world, these commands are your new best friends.</p>

    <p>🗓️ The next Tech-Savvy update drops on <strong>September 22nd, 2025</strong> (Greek Time)—and trust me, it’s going to be epic. Until then, stay curious, stay creative, and stay tech-savvy! 💡💬</p>
