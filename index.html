    <h1>Networking Commands for CMD on Windows 11 💻</h1>

    <p>Hello everyone! Welcome back to the <strong>Tech-Savvy Project</strong> 🎉 Today we’re diving into the world of networking commands on Windows 11. These are the tools your computer uses to talk to the internet, other devices, and even itself. Let’s explore 12 of them in a way that’s fun, friendly, and beginner-proof. Ready? Let’s go! 🚀</p>

    <h2>1. NETSTAT</h2>
    <p>Shows active connections and listening ports. Think of it as your computer’s chat log with other devices.</p>

    <h2>2. NSLOOKUP</h2>
    <p>Asks the DNS system: “Where does google.com live?” and gets back an IP address. Like looking up someone’s address in a phone book.</p>

    <h2>3. PING</h2>
    <p>Plays Marco Polo with another computer. Sends a signal and waits for a reply to check if the other device is reachable.</p>

    <h2>4. TRACERT</h2>
    <p>Shows the path your message takes to reach its destination. Like tracking a letter through every post office it visits.</p>

    <h2>5. IPCONFIG</h2>
    <p>Displays your computer’s IP address, subnet mask, and gateway. It’s like your digital home address and how you get outside.</p>

    <h2>6. HOSTNAME</h2>
    <p>Reveals your computer’s name tag. Useful for identifying devices on a network.</p>

    <h2>7. ARP</h2>
    <p>Matches IP addresses to MAC addresses. Like asking, “Who is 192.168.1.5?” and getting a face to go with the name.</p>

    <h2>8. GETMAC</h2>
    <p>Shows your computer’s MAC address—its unique bracelet number on the network.</p>

    <h2>9. NETSH</h2>
    <p>A powerful tool to manage network settings. You can reset Wi-Fi, change IPs, and more. Like admin mode in a video game!</p>

    <h2>10. PATHPING</h2>
    <p>Combines ping and tracert. Checks each stop along the way and tells you if any are slow or dropping messages.</p>

    <h2>11. SYSTEMINFO</h2>
    <p>Displays detailed info about your computer—OS version, memory, processor, and more. Like reading your PC’s resume.</p>

    <h2>12. TELNET</h2>
    <p>Connects to another computer and lets you type commands as if you’re sitting at its keyboard. Just be careful—it’s not secure like SSH!</p>

    <h2>🎉 That’s a Wrap!</h2>
    <p>Wow—you made it through 12 powerful networking commands! From <code>ping</code> to <code>telnet</code>, you’ve now got a toolkit that makes you feel like a network ninja 🥷.</p>

    <p>Whether you’re troubleshooting Wi-Fi, checking your IP, or just curious how your computer talks to the world, these commands are your new best friends.</p>

    <p>🗓️ The next Tech-Savvy update drops on <strong>September 22nd, 2025</strong> (Greek Time)—and trust me, it’s going to be epic. Until then, stay curious, stay creative, and stay tech-savvy! 💡💬</p>
