In Sugarplum Hollow, where candy canes grew like trees and marshmallow snow blanketed the hills,
a crisis was brewing: the Gingerbread Village had vanished!

Only crumbs remained. The villagers were distraught. Who could have stolen an entire village?

Enter Captain Cinnamon, the bravest cookie in the land, with frosting armor and gumdrop boots.
He vowed to find the missing village before Christmas morning.

Through blizzards of powdered sugar and tunnels of toffee, he searched.

At last, in the shadow of the Chocolate Mountains, he found it:
The Gingerbread Village — trapped in a snow globe by the mischievous Ice Cream Witch!

"Release them!" he cried.

The witch cackled, "Only a true act of Christmas spirit can break the spell!"
'@

$frames += @'
Captain Cinnamon knelt and sang a carol so sweet, so full of love and hope,
that the globe cracked open with a burst of peppermint light.

The villagers cheered! Gumdrop lanterns lit the sky. The Ice Cream Witch melted into whipped cream,
and peace returned to Sugarplum Hollow.

From that day on, the village sang together every Christmas Eve — just in case magic was needed again.
